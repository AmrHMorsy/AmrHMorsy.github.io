    - title: Ocean Simulation | (C++, OpenGL)
      description: 
        - Real-time ocean simulation developed in OpenGL, using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for wave simulation and OpenCL for optimization. Features Physically-Based Rendering (PBR), image-based lighting (IBL), and an HDR skybox. Inspired by Jerry Tessendorf's paper 'Simulating Ocean Water'.

    - title: Game Engine | (C++, Vulkan)
      description: Game engine developed in Vulkan, featuring Physically-Based Rendering (PBR), Image-Based Lighting (IBL), HDR skybox, volumetric fog, shadow mapping, dynamic tessellation, and noise generation. Integrated collision detection, skeletal animation, rigid body physics, and compute shaders for performance.

    - title: Procedural Terrain Generation | (C++, OpenGL)
      description: Real-time procedural multifractal terrain generation, developed in OpenGL, that generates infinite multifractal terrains using Fractal Brownian Motion (fBM) and Perlin Noise. Features Physically-Based Rendering (PBR), Image-Based Lighting (IBL), HDR skybox and Volumetric Fog Rendering.

    - title: Cloth Simulation | (C++, OpenGL)
      description: Real-time cloth simulation, developed in OpenGL, that employs a Mass-Spring System, inspired by the paper "Fast Simulation of Mass- Spring Systems" by Liu et al. Parallelized using Compute Shaders and features Physically-Based Rendering (PBR), image-based lighting (IBL) and an HDR skybox.
