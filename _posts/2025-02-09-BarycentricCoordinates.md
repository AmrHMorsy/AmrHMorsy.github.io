### **Introduction** <br>
<br>

A **nondegenerate** triangle is a triangle where: 

- All vertices are distinct
- The vertices do not all lie on a single line (Non-collinear vertices)

<br>

Consider the following **nondegenerate** triangle with vertices $$A$$, $$B$$, and $$C$$. 


<br>
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html loading="eager" path="assets/img/Blog/Barycentric_Coordinates/1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<br>


A point $$Q$$ that lies on the edge $$AB$$ has the form

$$
Q = (1-t)A + tB
$$

where $$0 \leq t \leq 1$$. 

<br>
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html loading="eager" path="assets/img/Blog/Barycentric_Coordinates/2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<br>

Similarly, a point $$R$$ that lies on the edge $$QC$$ has the form 

$$
R = (1-s)Q + sC
$$

where $$0 \leq s \leq 1$$.

<br>
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html loading="eager" path="assets/img/Blog/Barycentric_Coordinates/3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<br>

We can rewrite $$R$$ by substituting the equation for $$Q$$. This results in the following equation

$$
R = (1-s)((1-t)A + tB) + sC
$$

$$
R = (1-s)(1-t)A + (1-s)tB + sC
$$

Now, if we sum the coefficients of equation of $$R$$, we get

$$
(1-s)(1-t) + (1-s)t + s = (1 - t - s + st) + (t - st) + s = 1
$$

Since $$R$$ is an arbitrary point inside the triangle $$ABC$$, we can generalize the equation to any point $$P$$. 

That is, any point $$P$$ inside the triangle $$ABC$$ has the form

$$
P = αA + βB + γC
$$

where $$α + β + γ = 1 $$ and $$α, β, γ \geq 0$$. 

These coefficients $$α$$, $$β$$ and $$γ$$ are called the **barycentric coordinates** of of $$P$$ with respect to the triangle $$ABC$$, such that 

- If $$α = 0$$, then $$P$$ lies on the edge $$BC$$
- If $$β = 0$$, then $$P$$ lies on the edge $$AC$$
- If $$γ = 0$$, then $$P$$ lies on the edge $$AB$$.

### **Calculating Barycentric Coordinates** <br>
<br>

The equations for calculating the barycentric coordinates are


$$
α = \frac{Area(▲PBC)}{Area(▲ABC)}
$$

$$
β = \frac{Area(▲PAC)}{Area(▲ABC)}
$$

$$
γ = \frac{Area(▲PAB)}{Area(▲ABC)}
$$


The proof for these equations will be explained in the last section of this blog post.

<br>
### **Calculating Area of the Triangle** <br>
<br>

There are 2 ways to calculate the area of the triangle: 

**Approach 1**

The area of the triangle is 

$$
Area = \frac{1}{2} \times Base \times Height
$$

where $$Height$$ is the perpendicular shortest distance from the the base edge to the opposite vertex. 

For example, the area of triangle $$PBC$$ is 

$$
Area(▲PBC) = \frac{1}{2} \times ||\vec{BC}|| \times d_{⊥} (P,BC)
$$

    </div>
</div>
<br>

**Approach 2**

Another easier way to calculate the area of the triangle, is to use the area of the parallelogram. 

Consider the parallelogram $$ABCD$$. The area of the parallelogram $$ABCD$$ is 

$$
Area(▰ABCD) = ||\vec{AB}|| \times ||\vec{AC}|| \times sin(\theta)
$$

We can also express the area of the parallelogram $$ABCD$$ as the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors that lie on the parallelogram. That is, 

$$
Area(▰ABCD) = ||\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC}|| 
$$

The area of the triangle is equal to half the area of the parallelogram. Hence, the area of the triangle $$ABC$$ can be expressed as 

$$
Area(▲ABC) = \frac{||\vec{AB}|| \times ||\vec{AC}|| \times sin(\theta)}{2} = \frac{||\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC}|| }{2}
$$

        {% include figure.html loading="eager" path="assets/img/Blog/Barycentric_Coordinates/7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<br>

<br>
### **Proof** <br>
<br>

Consider the triangle $$ABC$$. Let $$P$$ be a point inside the triangle. We know that 

$$
P = αA + βB + γC
$$

where $$α + β + γ = 1 $$ and $$α, β, γ \geq 0$$. 

<br>
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html loading="eager" path="assets/img/Blog/Barycentric_Coordinates/5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<br>

We want to prove that 

$$
α = \frac{Area(▲PBC)}{Area(▲ABC)}
$$

$$
β = \frac{Area(▲PAC)}{Area(▲ABC)}
$$

$$
γ = \frac{Area(▲PAB)}{Area(▲ABC)}
$$

Without loss of generality, consider the barycentric coordinate $$α$$. 

Let $$d_P$$ be the perpendicular distance from $$P$$ to $$BC$$ and $$d_A$$ be the perpendicular distance from $$A$$ to $$BC$$. 

<br>
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html loading="eager" path="assets/img/Blog/Barycentric_Coordinates/9.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<br>

We know that the area of triangle $$PBC$$ is 

$$
Area(▲PBC) = \frac{1}{2} \times ||\vec{BC}|| \times d_P
$$

and the area of triangle $$ABC$$ is 

$$
Area(▲ABC) = \frac{1}{2} \times ||\vec{BC}|| \times d_A
$$

From these equations, we can see that
- $$Area(▲PBC)$$ is linearly proportional to the perpendicular distance from $$P$$ to $$BC$$ -- $$d_P$$

$$
Area(▲PBC) ∝ d_P
$$

- $$Area(▲ABC)$$ is linearly proportional to the perpendicular distance from $$A$$ to $$BC$$ -- $$d_A$$. 

$$
Area(▲ABC) ∝ d_A
$$

As $$d_P$$ decreases, the point $$P$$ becomes closer to the edge $$BC$$, causing the value of $$α$$ to also decrease. When $$d_P=0$$, the point $$P$$ lies on the edge $$BC$$ and $$α=0$$. 

<br>
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html loading="eager" path="assets/img/Blog/Barycentric_Coordinates/10.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<br>

As $$d_P$$ increases, the point $$P$$ becomes closer to the point $$A$$, causing the value of $$α$$ to increase. When $$d_P=d_A$$, the point $$P$$ coincides the point $$A$$ and $$α=1$$. 

<br>
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html loading="eager" path="assets/img/Blog/Barycentric_Coordinates/11.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<br>

This implies that $$α$$ is proportional to $$d_P$$

$$
α ∝ d_P
$$

where the proportionality constant is $$d_A$$. 

That is, 

$$
α = \frac{d_P}{d_A}
$$

Since $$d_P$$ is linearly proportional to $$Area(PBC)$$ and $$d_A$$ is linearly proportional to $$Area(ABC)$$, then we can rewrite $$α$$ as


$$
α = \frac{Area(▲PBC)}{Area(▲ABC)}
$$

By applying the same reasoning to the other two coordinates, we obtain that 

$$
β = \frac{Area(▲PAC)}{Area(▲ABC)}
$$

$$
γ = \frac{Area(▲PAB)}{Area(▲ABC)}
$$

Thus, proof is complete.
