**Welcome !** <br>
<br>

My name is **Amr Morsy**, and I am a **graphics programmer**. 

I specialize in low-level graphics programming, working with APIs like **OpenGL**, **Vulkan**, **Metal**, and **Direct3D** to develop games, simulations, and custome game engines.

<br>

I sell [**games**](https://amrhmorsy.github.io/games/), [**courses**](https://amrhmorsy.github.io/courses/), and [**game engines**](https://amrhmorsy.github.io/gameengines/). 

I also offer [**freelancing**](https://amrhmorsy.github.io/freelancing/) and [**tutoring**](https://amrhmorsy.github.io/tutoring/) services in graphics programming for both students and professionals.

On my [**blog**](https://amrhmorsy.github.io/blog/), I share tutorials, development insights, and reflections from my journey in computer graphics.
