<br> 

**Welcome !** <br>
<br>

My name is **Amr Morsy**, and I am a **graphics programmer**. 

I specialize in low-level graphics programming, working with APIs like **OpenGL**, **Vulkan**, **Metal**, and **Direct3D** to develop custome game engines and real-time applications, including games, simulations and animations. 

<br>

I offer **freelancing** and **tutoring** services in graphics programming for both students and professionals.

On my [blog](https://amrhmorsy.github.io/blog/), I share tutorials, development insights, and reflections from my journey in computer graphics.
